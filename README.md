# Non-parametric-test-for-two-way-ANOVA
Traditional two-way ANOVA under normality assumption of variances, homogeneity of variances, and
linearity assumptions is typically not satisfied in practice. Nonparametric tests have been suggested to
overcome these limitations, rank transform (RT) test, and aligned rank test(ART). These techniques also
suffer from the same kind of limitations such as conservativeness and no control over Type I error rates.
This study formulates a kernel regression-based approach to nonparametric two-way ANOVA with a
flexible, more powerful ability to handle non-normal data, handle unbalanced factorial designs and
maintain statistical power. The proposed approach is contrasted with existing practices, demonstrating
that it has value in real-world applications.
